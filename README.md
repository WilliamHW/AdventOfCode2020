# Advent of Code 2020

Yet another poor soul bashing their head against the Advent of Code challenge. This time in Python. How original.

## Making it work

To be able to download your puzzle inputs, this project expects your AoC session token to be saved in a file called `.session`. To retrieve this session token:

 - Log in to adventofcode.com
 - Open your developer console (e.g. right-click on the page and select `Inspect`)
 - In Chrome, go to the `Application` tab. In Firefox, go to the `Storage` tab.
 - Expand `Cookies` in the left-hand panel.
 - Select `https://adventofcode.com`
 - You will see an item named `session`. The value for this cookie is your session token.
